# Welcome :v
### A home/dumpster of small scripts and projects that aren't worth for an entire repository
This is probably an little place for examples, small scripts that i made, and more (?

For start, enter to an folder and read the documentation inside for make it work

- PHP scripts are maded in 7.0 - 5.0, i cant remember
- Node.JS (Javascript) files requires an version >8.0 | >11.x
- C, C++ files requires GCC or Linux, idk if they can be compiled on Windows
- Java files require JRE/JDK +8 | +11.x
- Some Python files in here aren't of my property and i don't know who they belong to, but if you find one, then it might or might not have an interesting purpose, in doubt, use Python 2.7.x

Every code and script here it's under an MIT license, if you use some of these scripts on a project, consider sharing some credit ?(
Have fun! (:D)/
