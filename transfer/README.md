## Remote file uploader
Simple remote file uploader, fill in one field the url/path of the fail and in the other field fill it with the filename to be stored locally
Take note, it depends of "max_execution_time" value var in php.ini, if it is in a short timeout, and the internet of host isnt good, the perfomance will be affected.
