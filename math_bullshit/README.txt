quadratic_func.js can only be used with Node.JS, download it from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download

For the C variant, quadratic_func.c, you need to install gcc then run build_quadratic_func.sh for build a binary (binary is located at the automatically generated "build" directory), only tested on Linux, feel free to port it yourself to Windows
